 Monty Bytecode is an intermediate code that is generated by the Python compiler and executed by the Python interpreter. It is a way of optimizing the execution of Python programs and making them run faster. 
Bytecode is a low-level representation of the original Python code that is optimized for execution by the computer.

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
